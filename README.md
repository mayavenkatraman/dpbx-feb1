# dpbx-feb1

Milestones: 



1 Setup:Create a new project (disable Auto Layout). [DONE]
1 Setup: Add the image assets above. [DONE]
1 Setup : Configure the app icon and splash screen. DONE for appicon, splash screen does not want to show

2 Welcome screens In the Storyboard, add three view controllers for the three welcome screens. 
Add an image view to each view controller that fills the view and set it to the welcome screen images.[DONE]
2 Welcome screens Add UIButtons to the next buttons and create modal segues to the next view controller. [DONE]

3. Create account / Sign in
At the last welcome screen, the user can choose to Sign Up or Sign In. 
In the Dropbox app, after leaving the Welcome screens, they can't return. 
They are taken immediately to the sign up or sign in form. If they hit the back button, they are taken to another signed out screen, shown below.




3. Signed In, New User [DONE]


4. Signed In, Existing User
[DONE - I think]

5. Logging Out
Add a button on top of the Log Out button and create a modal segue back to the navigation controller before the logged out view.
[DONE - but the button is in a random place

Time so far : 4.5 hours ? 

Still need to do : 
- My button to log out is in the wrong location. How do I place it at a certain location after scroll?
- I have it set up so that users still have to click - not using the auto transition
